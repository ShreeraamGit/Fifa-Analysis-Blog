## Installation.

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using FIFA palyer database from 2017-2020 to better understand:

 - Which European Clubs are spending more on wages.?
 - Which European Clubs are fielding more Younger players than any other clubs in the Top Flight Competitions.?
 - Do managers have an Impact on building their Respective teams and increasing the performance of their team players.?(We will See the Elite Team Managers such as Pep Guardiola, Jürgen Klopp, Zinedine Zidane).

The full set of files related to th analysis,are publicly available here. However, you can see detailed analysis in my blog post @medium.

## File Descriptions.

There is 1  notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. 
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results.

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here, https://medium.com/@shreeraamalagarsamysethuraj/few-facts-nobody-told-you-about-european-football-and-the-managers-34ef55cecb88
